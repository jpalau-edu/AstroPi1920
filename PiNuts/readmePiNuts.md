# SUMMARY

When we began researching for an experiment idea we came across a picture of astronaut Chris Hadfield on ISS playing guitar in shorts which led us to wonder how hot it really feels on ISS (heat index).

It turns out apparent temperature is an important factor in demanding environments like on board ISS because it can decrease motor skills and mental performance thus making completing tasks and avoiding errors more difficult.

Our goal is to find out heat index from on-board temperature, pressure and humidity by means of psychrometric calculations.
For a known humidity level on ISS of around 60% we expect the heat index (HI) to be lower than 28ºC  (actual temperature being ≤27ºC or ≤80F) since higher values could pose a threat to crew safety and efficiency (Fig-5).
