# SUMMARY

Climate change has increased the frequency and extent of wildfires all around the world which is something countries with low rainfall like ours are most concerned with and the main reason we've chosen wildfire tracking as a research topic.
Satellite fire monitoring helps visualizing the impact on ecosystems as well as assessing smoke and carbon emissions into the atmosphere. At a smaller scale, tracking allows communities to take better care of its natural resources.
To find out if affordable tools like a Raspberry Pi and the NoIR camera module are a viable means of keeping an eye on the environment our team intended to spot wildfire areas using NDVI techniques on pictures taken by AstroPi's near-infrared camera and subsequently estimate gross burnt area.
NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) takes advantage of the fact that healthy vegetation mostly absorbs blue and red light and reflects green and infrared. A camera that doesn't block IR fitted with a blue filter that gets rid of green light let us examine the ratio between blue and IR amounts thus sorting areas according to photosynthetic activity. In that regard, burnt areas should stand out against their surroundings.
